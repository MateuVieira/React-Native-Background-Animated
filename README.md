# React-Native-Background-Animated

A simple test on how to implement animation using Animated from the React Native.

It is the first time that I do this type of animation and the project is just the beginning. During the test, the result is very good, because the layout has no other elements, but when the layout has a TextInput and it has the focus, the animation hangs for a few seconds.

# A quick introduction to the project:

Project using Expo to start: 
```
yarn start
expo start
```

The objective of this project:

- Learning how to use Animated;
- Create an animation to the background;
- The animation has to translate on the X and Y axes;
- Have an infinity loop;

# More about the project:

I want to create animation with this image, this way create the infinity loop may be easier:

If some styles on the image, for this I'm using the ImageBackground, the result is this:

And finally with the animation:
